Hello!

I am a senior undergraduate at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Science, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCMUS). I'm especially interested in geometry and topology. I am also an AI Resident at the FPT Software AI Residency program, working on problems in graph learning.
